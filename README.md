# TinyLlama-Colorist-FineTune

This project aims to fine-tune the TinyLlama model for optimized color generation. The fine-tuning process is crucial for adapting the TinyLlama model's core features to the concept of color generation and achieving desired color outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the TinyLlama model specifically for color generation.
- **LoRA Configuration:** Optimizing model performance using LoRA (Lora) configuration.
- **Training Data Association:** Associating the training dataset with user input (description) to obtain the desired color output.
